Day 3
	1. Bubble Sort
	2. Merge Sort

	Till now we created threads using objects of the thread class

		tObj = Thread(target=...,args = .....)
	
	Now we will see how to create a class which inherits Thread class

	read varValue
		perform operation
		then assign

	data+=1

	--->data = data + 1

	data sharing in same variable intermediately then data will lost
	common data race condition

	Critical Section
	1 or 0 --> binary semaphorei or mutex or mutually exclusive

	1 is getting so other will be zero

	Counting Semaphore

	Locking facility
	If we use fun() then it wont get any error other if call fun then data will be corrupted

	Message Passing Interface	is a protocol
		mpi4py ---> 
			pip install
		one Window
			mpi package for windows from microsoft

	Try this Using globally & locally through lock

		Using putty we can run this program through other ip
	PASL library Parallel algorithm scheduling
