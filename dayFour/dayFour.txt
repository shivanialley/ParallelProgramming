Revision on Parallel Programming:

	Parallel Computing, parellel processing or multi-processing is to enable or perform multiple tasks/programs to run simultaneously on multiple processsors.
	What we temd to do is by splitting a single task into multiple, independant samller or sub-tasks. Where each sub-tasks is nothing but set of instructions which can run simultaneously on different processors

	From your shell point of view...
		man taskset

			0001 -->1#bitmasking #only 1 processor
			0011 -->3 --> #bit value mask command run 1 & 2 processor
			0100 --> 4#run at 4th processor only
			-p pid for run particular pid

		taskset 1 ./testOne & #it is assigning which cpu
		./cpu.py & #it is taking automatically
		jobs
		taskset -p 55
		taskset -p 4 55
		ps a
		nproc


		0111  1111 -->127
		1111  1111 --> 255

		--cpu-lists 0-7
		for more info refer to manual page of taskset command
			man taskset


		If something is running in background then we cant use ctrl c then we have to use kill -2 [pid]	

		kill -l 
		man kill

		wc -l fileName.out
	

		ps -af
		man ps
		ps -eLf
		ps s
		ps a
		ps -L
		ps u
